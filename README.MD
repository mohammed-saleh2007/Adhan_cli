# Python fajr alarm
I made this bomb script as an plan C for organizing my study instead lf makeing android app in this busy time or use a dumbass app from playstore

## How to use?
just you need to perform this commands in termux(i made it in my tab and for my tab:)
```
pkg update
pkg install python3 play-audio openssl
pip install requests
```
after setting the termux environment, run the alarm.py file:
```
python3 alarm.py
```
just let it running and this script will listen for the now time and get fajr time from internet and wait for the fajr time come then run the file called m.m4a
